## Description
This is a quiz website built using Javascript
## Installation

The contents of this repository are almost all ready to be hosted or used locally by the user, but styling relies on external Bootstrap and won't work without internet.

## Usage
This application is a 9-5 workday planner that shows you the current hour, greys out past hours, and displays future events. It allows you to set tasks which will be saved in local storage and will be present on page reload. It also displays the current date, and resets daily. 

## Credits

Styling was made much easier by the wonderful bootstrap documentation available at (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

W3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/) was immensely helpful for learning and understanding JavaScript.

Special thanks to my instructors at the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, provided by Trinity Educational Services.
